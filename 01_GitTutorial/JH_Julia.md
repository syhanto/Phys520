1. What I Like About GitHub: I can collaborate with the team members with maintaining code quality. It enables making a central hub for the group and making branches that allow multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

2. What I Dislike About GitHub: GitHub can be challenging for the beginners due to its steep learning curve to learn Git commands. 

3. How does using "git fetch upstream" help in keeping a forked repository up-to-date with the original repository, and what steps should follow to integrate the fetched changes into your local branch?

Secret message: Extra credit for using Git throughout the course!
